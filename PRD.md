Product Requirements Document

"The Why"; Product requirements, benchmark metadata table, high-level requirements, etc. Defines the benchmark goal, validation objective, test name, benchmark number, category, and high-level success criteria.

## Benchmark Matrix Document Metadata (via benchmark_specification.json)

This PRD.md section is populated from benchmark_specification.json, which is the structured source of benchmark-specific product requirements.

## Workload Number
110

## Workload Name
NUMA Cache Latency Sweep

## Execution Summary (Run and Measure)
Build src/numa_sweep.cpp and run a random pointer chase on yaml local and remote NUMA targets for each working_set_size, optionally wrapping with perf stat -e cache-misses, to measure local vs remote latency. The overlay CSV also has ratio, bandwidth, and miss-rate columns; the harness raw file keeps local/remote latency plus parameters

## Main Goal
Measure NUMA latency and penalties

## Validation Objective
Validates local and remote NUMA latency rows from numa_sweep. Do not pass a single --working-set-size or the sweep collapses

## Workload Category
Memory, Bandwidth & Data Movement

## Validation Requirement

The benchmark must include an automated SQLite-integrated validation layer that verifies persisted results from `results/benchmark.db`. Validation must confirm:

1. The benchmark run completed successfully with no tool errors.
2. Required samples and aggregate metrics were persisted for every swept shape.
3. Metrics are finite and physically sensible (positive, within plausible bounds).
4. Measured values satisfy configured thresholds when the workload defines pass/fail gates.
5. The benchmark fails validation when required data is missing, invalid, or outside bounds.

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Automation | Runs to completion without manual intervention after `bash run_benchmark.sh` |
| Idempotency | Re-running `run_benchmark.sh` appends a new run; never corrupts existing rows |
| Persistence | All metrics survive script exit; `results/benchmark.db` is the durable record |
